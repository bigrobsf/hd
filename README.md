# LIFT

This will be a simple workout tracking app based on a bodybuilding approach in the "High-Intensity Training" category called "Heavy Duty." Heavy Duty was developed in the late 70's and is still used by many today. Although a number of variations on the approach appeared over time, the classic version is that a person does a full body workout two or three times a week. Each workout consists of one set of a static collection of different exercises, each done to failure. The goal is to increase the number of reps performed up to a point when one would increase the weight.

The app will track, by user, by workout, the weight and number of reps for each exercise. It will have the ability to add a tag to each exercise indicating degree of difficulty - too light, too heavy, no failure, total failure...

The user will be able to export everything to a file.

## Possible later enhancements:

Display a chart of work done (reps x weight) per workout, perhaps for the past three months. I'm guessing this part would only work on a desktop.

Display a chart for each exercise so that the user could see progress by exercise by workout over a user-specified period of time.

Allow a user to add their own custom tags.

Allow a user to add their own exercises and thus create their own workout.

Allow a user to press a button at the beginning and end of the workout to determine the workout length.
